            //An example of a method in chapter 4 is Console.WriteLine method. A Console.WriteLine method requires a specific argument or statement of data and displays it in a console window. For exmaple, Console.WriteLine("Hello World!)" will play the message Hello World! in a console window.

            //The difference between a class and an object is that an object is created from a class declaration. Each class that is created is a new type that one can use to create objects in it. There should be no limit as to how many instances of a class can be created. Im sure you can create as much as your memory can hold.
